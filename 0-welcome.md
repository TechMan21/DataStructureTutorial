# Python Fundamentals Tutorial with Data Structures

Hello and welcome to a tutorial on Python fundamentals with data structures! There are many data structutes out there in the programming world but we will just focus on a few today. The topics we will go over are:

- [Stacks](1-stacks.md)
- [Linked Lists](2-linkedList.md)
- [Trees](3-trees.md)

Each of these topics has a module via the links above. Every module will go over the basics, provide understanding, connect it with the Python language, prvide an example, and give you a Try-It-Out exercise (after your own attempt to the exercise you can view a provided solution).
